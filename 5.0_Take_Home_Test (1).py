HONOR CODE: I solemnly promise that while taking this test I will only use PyCharm or the Internet,
but I will definitely not ask another person except the instructor. Signed: ______________________


1. Write a Python program that will use a FOR loop to print your name
     10 times, and then the word Done at the end.
 '''  


'''
  2. Write a Python program that will use a FOR loop to print Blue
     and then White 20 times. (Blue White Blue White Blue White... all on separate lines.
     Don't use \n.)
'''


'''
  3. Write a Python program that will use a FOR loop to print the even
     numbers from 2 to 100, inclusive.
'''



'''
  4. Write a Python program that will use a WHILE loop to count from
     10 down to, and including, 0. Then print the words Blast off! Remember, use
     a WHILE loop, don't use a FOR loop.
'''


'''
  5. There are three things wrong with this program. List each.
     
     print("This program takes three numbers and returns the sum.")
     total = 0

     for i in range(3):
         x = input("Enter a number: ")
         total = total + i
     print("The total is:", x)
'''


'''
  6. Write a program that prints a random integer from 1 to 10 (inclusive).
'''


'''
  7. Write a program that prints a random floating point number somewhere between
     1 and 10 (inclusive). Do not make the mistake of generating a random number from
     0 to 10 instead of 1 to 10.
'''


'''
  8. Write a Python program that will:
     
     * Ask the user for seven numbers
     * Print the total sum of the numbers
     * Print the count of the positive entries, the number entries equal to zero,
     and the number of negative entries. Use an if, elif, else chain, not just three
     if statements.
