ROSHAMBO PROGRAM
----------------

Create a program that randomly prints 1, 2, or 3.
Expand the program so it randomly prints rock, paper, or scissors using if statements. Don't select from a list.
Add to the program so it first asks the user their choice as well as if they want to quit.
(It will be easier if you have them enter 1 for rock, 2 for paper, and 3 for scissors.)
Add conditional statements to figure out who wins and keep the records
When the user quits print a win/loss record
